My doctor friend asked me “**How do you engage with software developers to ensure that your application meets your business needs?**” Well, we are in 2021,smartphones are being used widely. All are probably using lots of mobile apps to do things, such as food ordering, hotel booking, online shopping, or such simple apps like flashlight, clock, and even more. All businesses are adopting applications into their process.

**Why is communicating with software developers so hard?**

Let’s think about a car. 
[picture of car and many cars]

Do you think yourself, your friends and other people will imagine exactly the same car? Absolutely not, there are so many features that make each car different.

Make, colour, seat gearbox,number of doors, engine size.

Everyone has their own preferences. You cannot just tell a car dealer that you want a car and get exactly what you want. You need to be specific. Luckily, you can select various pre-built options from your car dealer or make it built to order. Application is not, it is new to the world and in the beginning of its era. Developers need to build it from scratch. They cannot use pre-built code to create applications in your dream.

Since these options are not standardized in software development, not pre-built and not tangible in the real world, communicating to develop software from abstraction is hard! If you are not specifically tell what you want, you might get something totally different.

**What are the minimum requirements for software development?**

To make it easier we need to turn non tangible concepts to something tangible. For example, business requirements and some wireframe mockup should be prepared before we are talking to the developers. This builds shared understanding between yourself and software developers. These concepts are broken down into 3 tasks: building business requirements, building user interface, and developing applications.

These three functions are fundamental requirements to build an application. However, building a user interface can be shared responsibility between people on the business side, by building wireframes and improving what developers create,, and development' side, by using standard user interface libraries and keep improving when asked. As both person are not expert in the designing, do not expect it to be as nice as designer do!

**What is usually misunderstood?**

Myth: Building applications is simple. They are just an electronic form.
Fact: Developing an application is complex. It is similar to form but linked with strict business flow.

From a business standpoint, applications are more like processes or flow of multiple forms. Developers should understand the right process to develop applications that conforms to the process. It takes time to visualise correct business processes. Business people should make this clear before building shared understanding with developers. User Story Mapping by Jeff Patton, is suggesting the way to structure this process.

From technical standpoint, there are few technical requirement that business should understand
Security: How information should be kept. Who should be able to access and who should not.
Testing: What is the mechanism to ensure the stability of application e.g., deployment of new features won’t break applications.
Performance: How many active users are being expected in one time period. Forecast of how fast the number of users can grow. Is it possible to scale if it reaches performance capacity?

Experienced developers will ask more of these technical standpoint questions to the business side so please understand that they are trying their best for you if these are asked.

Myth: Developers can come up with a brand new nice user interface.
Fact: Not always. Building a user interface is the job of a designer. Only an experienced developer can do an OK interface by reuse existing user interface libraries. Developers are not experts in designing most of the time. Designers are good at this since his/her experience can tell if this look and feel is ok for the users. They know more about best practice in design so they can build and fine tune the interface to fit user needs.

**How do you engage with software developers to ensure that your application meets your business needs?**

We will answer these questions based on business standpoint.

Understand your process before seeing your developer. You should be sure that business processes and problems are being understood by yourself correctly. - Nothing will go right if you are trying to solve the wrong problems. Please make sure that business problems that you are trying to solve make sense. You cannot just believe what the user is saying. You need to dig down and find the real WHY. After that building simple diagrams usually helps!

Build and visualise shared understanding among the team (yourself, developer, and designer) - The book, I mentioned earlier, elaborate steps for building this shared understanding. Basically, you need to write down the user flow as a diagram and explain what happens in each process.

Build the first version of wireframe by yourself - If you are planning to build an interface without a designer this will help bridge communication between yourself and developers. Things get clearer and simpler by visualizing it. This helps developers spend less time thinking about what you want so they can spend time on the real development!

Provide some technical requirements to developers - Knowing how many users are planning to use an application, possible user growth, operating hours of apps and other information that is related to traffic is good for app dev. They can select the right architecture for your future needs. Security is also another point to work out with developers.

Hope this answers your questions!
